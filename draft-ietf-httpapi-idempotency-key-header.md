--- abstract

The HTTP Idempotency-Key request header field can be used to make non-idempotent HTTP methods such as `POST` or `PATCH` fault-tolerant.

--- middle

# Introduction

In mathematics and computer science, an idempotent operation is one that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. It does not matter if the operation is called only once or tens of times over.

Idempotency is important in building fault-tolerant HTTP APIs. An HTTP request method is considered `idempotent` if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request. Per {{!RFC9110}}, the methods `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` are idempotent while methods `POST` and `PATCH` are not.

Let's say a client of an HTTP API wants to create (or update) a resource using a `POST` method. Repeating the request multiple times can result in duplication or incorrect updates. Consider a scenario where the client sent a `POST` request to the server, but the request timed out. The client is left uncertain about the status of the resource. It doesn't know if the resource was created or updated, or if the server even completed processing the request. Furthermore, the client does not know if it can safely retry the request. 


##  Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of {{!RFC5234}} and includes, by reference, the IMF-fixdate rule as defined in Section 7.1.1.1 of {{!RFC7231}}.

The term "resource" is to be interpreted as defined in Section 2 of {{!RFC7231}}, that is identified by an URI. 

# The Idempotency-Key HTTP Request Header Field

An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the resource uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. The `Idempotency-Key` HTTP request header field carries this value.

## Syntax

`Idempotency-Key` is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its value MUST be a String (Section 3.3.3 of {{!RFC8941}}). 


## Uniqueness of Idempotency Key

The idempotency key MUST be unique and MUST NOT be reused with another request with a different request payload.

Uniqueness of the key MUST be defined by the resource owner and MUST be implemented by the clients of the resource. It is RECOMMENDED that a UUID {{!RFC4122}} or a similar random identifier be used as an idempotency key.

The following example shows an idempotency key whose value is a UUID {{!RFC4122}}:

    Idempotency-Key: "8e03978e-40d5-43e8-bc93-6894a57f9324"

## Idempotency Key Validity and Expiry

The resource MAY require time based idempotency keys to be able to purge or delete a key upon its expiry. The resource SHOULD define such expiration policy and publish it in the documentation.

## Idempotency Fingerprint

An idempotency fingerprint MAY be used in conjunction with an idempotency key to determine the uniqueness of a request. Such a fingerprint is generated from request payload data by the resource. An idempotency fingerprint generation algorithm MAY use one of the following or similar approaches to create a fingerprint.

* Checksum of the entire request payload.
* Checksum of selected element(s) in the request payload.
* Field value match for each field in the request payload.
* Field value match for selected element(s) in the request payload.
* Request digest/signature.


## Responsibilities

### Client

Clients of HTTP API requiring idempotency SHOULD understand the idempotency related requirements as published by the server and use appropriate algorithm to generate idempotency keys.

Clients MAY choose to send an Idempotency-Key field with any valid value to indicate the user's intent is to only perform this action once. Without a priori knowledge, a general client cannot assume the server will respect this request.

For each request, a client SHOULD:

* Send a unique idempotency key in the HTTP `Idempotency-Key` request header field.

### Resource

Resources MUST publish a idempotency related specification. This specification MUST include expiration related policy if applicable. A resource is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the idempotency key.

For each request, a server SHOULD:

* Identify idempotency key from the HTTP `Idempotency-Key` request header field.
* Generate idempotency fingerprint if required.
* Enforce idempotency (see below)


## Idempotency Enforcement

* First time request (idempotency key and fingerprint has not been seen)

  The resource SHOULD process the request normally and respond with an appropriate response and status code.

* Duplicate request (idempotency key and fingerprint has been seen)

  Retry

  The request was retried after the original request completed. The resource SHOULD respond with the result of the previously completed operation, success or an error. See Error Scenarios for details on errors.

  Concurrent Request

  The request was retried before the original request completed. The resource SHOULD respond with a resource conflict error. See Error Scenarios for details.


## Error Handling

If the `Idempotency-Key` request header is missing for a documented idempotent operation requiring this header, the resource SHOULD reply with an HTTP `400` status code with body containing a link pointing to relevant documentation. Following examples shows an error response describing the problem using {{!RFC7807}}.

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/problem+json
    Content-Language: en
    {
      "type": "https://developer.example.com/idempotency",
      "title": "Idempotency-Key is missing",
      "detail": "This operation is idempotent and it requires correct
       usage of Idempotency Key.",
    }
~~~

Alternately, using the HTTP header `Link`, the client can be informed about the error as shown below.

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
      rel="describedby"; type="text/html"
~~~

If there is an attempt to reuse an idempotency key with a different request payload, the resource SHOULD reply with a HTTP `422` status code with body containing a link pointing to relevant documentation. The status code `422` is defined in Section 15.5.21 of {{!RFC9110}}.

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
    Content-Type: application/problem+json
    Content-Language: en
    {
      "type": "https://developer.example.com/idempotency",
      "title": "Idempotency-Key is already used",
      "detail": "This operation is idempotent and it requires
      correct usage of Idempotency Key. Idempotency Key MUST not be
      reused across different payloads of this operation.",
    }
~~~

The server can also inform the client by using the HTTP header `Link` as shown below.

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
    Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
    rel="describedby"; type="text/html"
~~~

If the request is retried, while the original request is still being processed, the resource SHOULD reply with an HTTP `409` status code with body containing problem description.

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
    Content-Type: application/problem+json
    Content-Language: en
    {
      "type": "https://developer.example.com/idempotency",
      "title": "A request is outstanding for this Idempotency-Key",
      "detail": "A request with the same Idempotency-Key for the
      same operation is being processed or is outstanding.",
    }
~~~

Or, alternately using the HTTP header `Link` pointing to the relevant documentation

~~~ http-message
    HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
    Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
    rel="describedby"; type="text/html"
~~~

Error scenarios above describe the status of failed idempotent requests after the resource prcocesses them. Clients MUST correct the requests (with the exception of 409 where no correction is required) before performing a retry operation, or the resource MUST fail the request and return one of the above errors.

For other 4xx/5xx errors, such as 401, 403, 500, 502, 503, 504, 429, or any other HTTP error code that is not listed here, the client SHOULD act appropriately by following the resource's documentation.

# Security Considerations

This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
and users of known security concerns specific to the idempotency keys.

Resources that do not implement strong idempotency keys, such as UUIDs, or have appropriate controls to validate the idempotency keys, could be victim to various forms of security attacks from malicious clients:

* Injection attacks - When the resources does not validate the idempotency key in the client request and performs a idempotent cache lookup, there can be security attacks (primarily in the form of injection), compromising the server.
* Data leaks-When an idempotency implementation allows low entropy keys, attackers MAY determine other keys and use them to fetch existing idempotent cache entries, belonging to other clients.

To prevent such situations, the specification recommends the following best practices for idempotency key implementation in the resource.

* Establish a fixed format for the idempotency key and publish the key’s specification.
* Always validate the key as per its published specification before processing any request.
* On the resource, implement a unique composite key as the idempotent cache lookup key. For example, a composite key MAY be implemented by combining the idempotency key sent by the client with other client specific attributes known only to the resource.


# Examples

The first example shows an idempotency-key header field with key value using UUID version 4 scheme:

    Idempotency-Key: "8e03978e-40d5-43e8-bc93-6894a57f9324"

Second example shows an idempotency-key header field with key value using a random string generator:

    Idempotency-Key: "clkyoesmbgybucifusbbtdsbohtyuuwz"
