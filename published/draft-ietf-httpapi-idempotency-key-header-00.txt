1.  Introduction

   Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and
   computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without
   changing the result beyond the initial application.  It does not
   matter if the operation is called only once, or 10s of times over.
   The result SHOULD be the same.

   Idempotency is important in building a fault-tolerant HTTP API.  An
   HTTP request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended effect
   on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the
   same as the effect for a single such request.  According to
   [RFC7231], HTTP methods "OPTIONS", "HEAD", "GET", "PUT" and "DELETE"
   are idempotent while methods "POST" and "PATCH" are not.

   Let's say a client of an HTTP API wants to create (or update) a
   resource using a "POST" method.  Since "POST" is NOT an idempotent
   method, calling it multiple times can result in duplication or wrong
   updates.  Consider a scenario where the client sent a "POST" request
   to the server, but it got a timeout.  Following questions arise : Is
   the resource actually created (or updated)?  Did the timeout occur
   during sending of the request, or when receiving of the response?
   Can the client safely retry the request, or does it need to figure
   out what happened in the first place?  If "POST" had been an
   idempotent method, such questions may not arise.  Client would safely
   retry a request until it actually gets a valid response from the
   server.

   For many use cases of HTTP API, duplicate resource is a severe
   problem from business perspective.  For example, duplicate records
   for requests involving any kind of money transfer "MUST NOT" be
   allowed.  In other cases, processing of duplicate webhook delivery is
   not expected.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here, and without quotes.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] and includes, by reference, the IMF-fixdate
   rule as defined in Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231].

   The term "resource" is to be interpreted as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC7231], that is identified by an URI.  The term "resource server"
   is to be interpreted as "origin server" as defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC7231].

2.  The Idempotency-Key HTTP Request Header Field

   An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which
   the resource server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same
   request.  The "Idempotency-Key" HTTP request header field carries
   this key.

2.1.  Syntax

   The "Idempotency-Key" request header field describes

   Idempotency-Key       = idempotency-key-value

   idempotency-key-value = opaque-value
   opaque-value          = DQUOTE *idempotencyvalue DQUOTE
   idempotencyvalue      = %x21 / %x23-7E / obs-text
          ; VCHAR except double quotes, plus obs-text

   Clients MUST NOT include more than one "Idempotency-Key" header field
   in the same request.

   The following example shows an idempotency key using "UUID"
   [RFC4122]:

   Idempotency-Key: "8e03978e-40d5-43e8-bc93-6894a57f9324"

2.2.  Uniqueness of Idempotency Key

   The idempotency key that is supplied as part of every "POST" request
   MUST be unique and MUST NOT be reused with another request with a
   different request payload.

   Uniqueness of the key MUST be defined by the resource owner and MUST
   be implemented by the clients of the resource server.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that "UUID" [RFC4122] or a similar random identifier be
   used as an idempotency key.

2.3.  Idempotency Key Validity and Expiry

   The resource MAY enforce time based idempotency keys, thus, be able
   to purge or delete a key upon its expiry.  The resource server SHOULD
   define such expiration policy and publish in related documentation.

2.4.  Idempotency Fingerprint

   An idempotency fingerprint MAY be used in conjunction with an
   idempotency key to determine the uniqueness of a request.  Such a
   fingerprint is generated from request payload data by the resource
   server.  An idempotency fingerprint generation algorithm MAY use one
   of the following or similar approaches to create a fingerprint.

   *  Checksum of the entire request payload.

   *  Checksum of selected element(s) in the request payload.

   *  Field value match for each field in the request payload.

   *  Field value match for selected element(s) in the request payload.

   *  Request digest/signature.

2.5.  Responsibilities

   Client

   Clients of HTTP API requiring idempotency, SHOULD understand the
   idempotency related requirements as published by the server and use
   appropriate algorithm to generate idempotency keys.

   For each request, client SHOULD

   *  Send a unique idempotency key in the HTTP "Idempotency-Key"
      request header field.

   Resource Server

   Resource server MUST publish idempotency related specification.  This
   specification MUST include expiration related policy if applicable.
   Server is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the idempotency
   key.

   For each request, server SHOULD

   *  Identify idempotency key from the HTTP "Idempotency-Key" request
      header field.

   *  Generate idempotency fingerprint if required.

   *  Check for idempotency considering various scenarios including the
      ones described in section below.

2.6.  Idempotency Enforcement Scenarios

   *  First time request (idempotency key or fingerprint has not been
      seen)

      The resource server SHOULD process the request normally and
      respond with an appropriate response and status code.

   *  Duplicate request (idempotency key or fingerprint has been seen)

      Retry

      The request was retried after the original request completed.  The
      resource server MUST respond with the result of the previously
      completed operation, success or an error.

      Concurrent Request

      The request was retried before the original request completed.
      The resource server MUST respond with a resource conflict error.
      See Error Scenarios for details.

2.7.  Error Scenarios

   If the "Idempotency-Key" request header is missing for a documented
   idempotent operation requiring this header, the resource server MUST
   reply with an HTTP "400" status code with body containing a link
   pointing to relevant documentation.  Alternately, using the HTTP
   header "Link", the client can be informed about the error as shown
   below.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
     rel="describedby"; type="text/html"

   If there is an attempt to reuse an idempotency key with a different
   request payload, the resource server MUST reply with a HTTP "422"
   status code with body containing a link pointing to relevant
   documentation.  The status code "422" is defined in Section 11.2 of
   [RFC4918].  The server can also inform the client by using the HTTP
   header "Link" as shown below.

   HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
   rel="describedby"; type="text/html"

   If the request is retried, while the original request is still being
   processed, the resource server MUST reply with an HTTP "409" status
   code with body containing a link or the HTTP header "Link" pointing
   to the relevant documentation.

   HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
   rel="describedby"; type="text/html"

   For other errors, the resource MUST return the appropriate status
   code and error message.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  The Idempotency-Key HTTP Request Header Field

   The "Idempotency-Key" request header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into
   account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

   Header Field Name: Idempotency-Key

   Applicable Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

5.  Security Considerations

   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns specific to the idempotency
   keys.

   For idempotent request handling, the resources MAY make use of the
   value in the idempotency key to look up a cache or a persistent store
   for duplicate requests matching the key.  If the resource does not
   validate the value of the idempotency key prior to performing such a
   lookup, it MAY lead to various forms of security attacks and
   compromise.  To avoid such situations, the resource SHOULD publish
   the expected format of the idempotency key, algorithm used to
   generate it and always validate the key value as per the published
   specification before processing any request.

6.  Examples

   The first example shows an idempotency-key header field with key
   value using UUID version 4 scheme:

   Idempotency-Key: "8e03978e-40d5-43e8-bc93-6894a57f9324"

   Second example shows an idempotency-key header field with key value
   using some random string generator:

   Idempotency-Key: "clkyoesmbgybucifusbbtdsbohtyuuwz"
